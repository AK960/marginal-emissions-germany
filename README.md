# marginal-emissions-germany
This project contains a Python pipeline to compute marginal emission factors for the German electricity market. It processes high-resolution historical open source market data from official sources to model market dynamics beyond the merit-order principle and assess the environmental impact of heatpumps, based on their marginal emissions.
